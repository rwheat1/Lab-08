### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(skimr)
library(rvest)
```

```{r load-data, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Remove eval = FALSE or set it to TRUE once data is ready to be loaded

uoe_art <- read_csv("data/uoe-art.csv")
```

### Exercise 9

I got some warnings when running this code because we're computing a new variable for year *IF we have that information available. However, for some artwork, we don't have any that information -- so this error reflects those cases. Thus, I'm not worried about it.

```{r separate-title-date, error = TRUE}
uoe_art <- uoe_art %>%
  separate(title, into = c("title", "date"), sep = "\\(") %>%
  mutate(year = str_remove(date, "\\)") %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  select(title, artist, year, link)
```
